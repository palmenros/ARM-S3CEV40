# ARM-S3CEV40

Projects using ARM-S3CEV40 Embest Prototyping Board with an ARM7TDMI processor.

- `prac1a`: Buttons, LEDs, 8 segment displays, GPIO.
- `prac2a`: Interrupts, timers.
- `prac3a`: Matrix keypad.
- `prac4a`: UART with RX and TX FIFO buffer.
- `prac5a`: Real Time Clock (RTC) date time, tick interrupts, programmable alarm interrupts (wake up from low-power mode).
- `prac6a`: 320x240 LCD display, line rendering, 16x8 font, BMP image support. 
- `prac7a`: I2C controller, AT24C04 EEPROM (random and sequential).
- `prac8a`: DMA controller, L3 software driver, I2S sound driver, uda1341 driver (polling and DMA sound), WAV file reproduction, microphone and sound effects (volume, speed, echo, ...).
- `prac9a`: Analog to Digital Converter (polling and interrupt), touch screen (calibration, polling, interrupt).
- `prac10a`: Mutex implementation, sleep to low power (wake up from interrupts), three multitasking systems (foreground-background, function queue and cyclic executive).
- `prac11a`: Non-expropiative real time micro-kernel.
- `prac12a`: Multitasking under RTOS uC/OS-II port.
- `prac13a`: ROM-stored custom bootlader that loads program to RAM on powerup and reset.
